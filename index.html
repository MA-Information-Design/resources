        All Caps: <br>Towards a Reader on Design and Capitalism

            
      </td>
      <td>
        Capitalism has emerged as a contentious subject of debate within design circles, igniting discussions that
        extend beyond this mode of production to encompass potential alternatives. To gain a solid sense of the issue at
        hand, however, it is essential to explore the relationship between design and capitalism in its specificity.
        Sure, design and capitalism are inextricably related, but how? Does design play a privileged role in
        perpetuating the capitalist machine? Can we trace the evolution of ideas about this subject throughout history?
        Did these ideas change over time? Did new approaches emerge? In this two-day seminar, we have tried to answer
        these questions and move beyond generalizations. To do so, we immersed ourselves in an array of texts spanning
        more than a century. The goal of this analytical journey was to build the foundations for a reader on design and
        capitalism, a reader that would enable students, designers and researchers to act within a capitalist system,
        both theoretically and practically, with awareness and discernment.
